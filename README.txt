Personal accounting is a small script enabling myself to organize
my private accounting by providing a mobile app and command line
script to log all incomes and expenses ("transactions").

Transactions happen between "entities" and are tagged with keywords,
so you can analyze them later.

Goals
-----

Data storage

1. XML file for now
2. sqlite

Accounting capabilities

1. Will always stay limited. Analysis is meant to be done externally (use XML file)

Frontends

1. Command line interface
2. Mobile application (Android)
3. Web interface


best regards,
